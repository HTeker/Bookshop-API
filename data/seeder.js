He is ultra competitive but never forgets to have fun. An immensely likeable man.' Damon Hill The world's foremost designer in Formula One, Adrian Newey OBE is arguably one of Britain's greatest engineers and this is his fascinating, powerful memoir. How to Build a Car explores the story of Adrian's unrivalled 35-year career in Formula One through the prism of the cars he has designed, the drivers he has worked alongside and the races in which he's been involved. A true engineering genius, even in adolescence Adrian's thoughts naturally emerged in shape and form - he began sketching his own car designs at the age of 12 and took a welding course in his school summer holidays. From his early career in IndyCar racing and on to his unparalleled success in Formula One, we learn in comprehensive, engaging and highly entertaining detail how a car actually works. Adrian has designed for the likes of Mario Andretti, Nigel Mansell, Alain Prost, Damon Hill, David Coulthard, Mika Hakkinen, Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel, always with a shark-like purity of purpose: to make the car go faster. And while his career has been marked by unbelievable triumphs, there have also been deep tragedies; most notably Ayrton Senna's death during his time at Williams in 1994. Beautifully illustrated with never-before-seen drawings, How to Build a Car encapsulates, through Adrian's remarkable life story, precisely what makes Formula One so thrilling - its potential for the total synchronicity of man and machine, the perfect combination of style, efficiency and speed.", price: 14.91, imgUrl: 'https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/0081/9780008196806.jpg' },

Described as the most original voice in cricket, The Grade Cricketer represents the fading hopes and dreams of every ageing amateur sportsman. In this tell-all 'autobiography', The Grade Cricketer describes his cricketing career with unflinching honesty and plenty of humour, in turn providing insights into the hyper-masculine cricket 'dressing room'. This one-time junior prodigy is now experiencing the lean, increasingly existential years of adult cricket. Here, he learns quickly that one will need more than just runs and wickets to make it in the alpha-dominated grade cricket jungle, where blokes like Nuggsy, Bruiser, Deeks and Robbo reign supreme. Through it all, The Grade Cricketer lays bare his deepest insecurities - his relationship with Dad, his fleeting romances outside the cricket club - and, in turn, we witness a gentle maturation; a slow realisation that perhaps, just maybe, there is more to life than hitting 50 not out in third grade and enjoying a few celebratory beers afterwards. Or is there? The Grade Cricketer book is based upon the popular Twitter account, @gradecricketer, which has received critical acclaim for its frighteningly honest portrayal of amateur cricket. Now, the time has finally come for this middling amateur sportsman to tell his story in full. Ed Cowan: Australian Test Cricketer and Fox Sports presenter: 'The beauty of The Grade Cricketer is he is more than a grade cricketer - he is every cricketer, from the park to the SCG. His insights into the game make people laugh mostly because they reflect every cricketer's unspoken convictions. We all live vicariously through him, as he does us.'

		{ id: '0224100742', name: 'Klopp: Bring the Noise', description: "'I like the total intensification, when there are crashes and bangs everywhere, pure adrenaline and no one being able to breathe' Jurgen Klopp's super-sized personality and all-or-nothing style of football and management made him the perfect choice to pump up the volume at Anfield. The appointment sparked hysteria in the city with fans and club officials delighted to get the coach they'd long admired from afar and eager to see the impact he would have on the club and the Premier League. With exclusive access to Klopp's friends, family, colleagues and players, Raphael Honigstein goes behind-the-scenes at Liverpool, Mainz and Dortmund to tell the definitive story of Klopp's career, transformative footballing genius and how he is bringing the noise to Anfield. Klopp's the manager to turn players into winners, to get that little bit more from them and transform teams like mid-table Borussia Dortmund into title winners and one of Europe's most acclaimed sides in just two seasons. He's authentic, approachable and funny, charming media and fans alike. He's also merciless and exceptionally driven, his quick temper bubbling away barely under the surface. Expectations have been high and even when results haven't gone their way, Liverpool's exciting football and Klopp's pitch-side passion have enthralled, culminating in a triumphant return to Champions League football. Klopp follows his story from its Black Forest beginnings, as a player with 'fifth division skills and a first division brain', his accidental fall into management and the success at Mainz and Dortmund which paved the way to Anfield.", price: 12.02, imgUrl: 'https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/2241/9780224100748.jpg' },

		{ id: '080701429X', name: 'Man\'s Search for Meaning', description: "Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl's memoir has riveted generations of readers with its descriptions of life in Nazi death camps and its lessons for spiritual survival. Between 1942 and 1945 Frankl labored in four different camps, including Auschwitz, while his parents, brother, and pregnant wife perished. Based on his own experience and the experiences of others he treated later in his practice, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose. Frankl's theory-known as logotherapy, from the Greek word logos ('meaning')-holds that our primary drive in life is not pleasure, as Freud maintained, but the discovery and pursuit of what we personally find meaningful. At the time of Frankl's death in 1997, Man's Search for Meaning had sold more than 10 million copies in twenty-four languages. A 1991 reader survey for the Library of Congress that asked readers to name a 'book that made a difference in your life' found Man's Search for Meaning among the ten most influential books in America.", price: 8.31, imgUrl: 'https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/8070/9780807014295.jpg' },

Covering themes ranging from love and death to sex and politics, there's a story about a girl from Tipp being kicked out of ISIS, a van powered by Cork people's accents and a man who drags a fridge on his back through Limerick. Whip-smart, provocative and animated by the author's unmistakably dark wit, it is unlike anything else you will read this year. `Mad, wild, hysterical - this is a brilliant debut.' Kevin Barry, author of Dark Lies the Island `There is genius in this book, warped genius. Like you'd expect from a man who for his day job wears a plastic bag on his head but something beyond that too. Oddly in-keeping with the tradition of great Irish writers.' Russell Brand `One of Ireland's finest and most intelligent comic minds delivers stories so blisteringly funny and sharp your fingers might bleed. In language so delicious you can taste it, we're shown holy and unholy Ireland: a land of lock-ins, nettle stings, stone mad Cork birds, gas cunts and Guiney's jeans.

Tara Flynn `If you've ever witnessed a Rubberbandits video you'll be anxious to read this collection of short stories from one of the originators.
